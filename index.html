        <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Projects</h2>
        <p>
          I have worked on various projects, including automotive applications, cloud-based microservices, and government digital platforms. I specialize in backend development with testing, DevOps, and system architecture.
          Hobby projects usually on Python or C++ to get better at it, Java only for work. This web is done with Javascript + Vite tool + ThreeJS and Blender for animations.
